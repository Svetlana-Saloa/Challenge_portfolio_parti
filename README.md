# Task1: software configuration

## Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

### Hello!

#### *My name is Svitlana, I am 34 years old.* I am a mother who is currently unemployed in Poland. It is very difficult to find a job in a small town and my friend advised me to try the profession of a tester. And I was driven by the desire to work and earn money, maybe it's banal, but it's true.
#### I am a beginner, so I do not demand much from myself, but I will try to take the maximum amount of information from this course in order to find a decent job in the future.
